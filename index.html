    <p>Lebron James is an amazing basketball player. He is my favourite player. The positions that he plays are small foward and shooting gaurd.</p>
    <p>Anthony Davis is also an amazing basketball player. The positions that he plays are power foward and center.
      <p>Kobe is an amazing player who has won many awards. The positions that he plays are small foward and shooting gaurd.</p>
